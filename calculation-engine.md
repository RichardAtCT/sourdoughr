# Calculation Engine Component

## Purpose
The calculation engine is the core algorithmic component that processes input variables and determines fermentation time estimates based on temperature, starter percentage, and other factors.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Calculation Logic
- **Base Time Calculation**
  - Establish baseline fermentation time at reference conditions
  - Apply multipliers based on temperature and starter percentage
  - Formula: `BaseTime × TemperatureMultiplier × StarterPercentageMultiplier`
  
- **Temperature Processing**
  - Convert between temperature units as needed
  - Apply non-linear relationship between temperature and fermentation rate
  - Handle temperature ranges appropriately (including refrigeration)
  
- **Starter Percentage Processing**
  - Calculate impact of varying starter percentages on fermentation time
  - Account for starter health/activity factor (optional)

### Advanced Calculations
- **Secondary Factors Processing**
  - Apply modifiers for flour type
  - Calculate impact of salt percentage
  - Factor in dough hydration level
  - Consider ambient humidity effects
  
- **Confidence Intervals**
  - Calculate statistical range for fermentation time estimates
  - Determine optimal "window" for desired fermentation level

### Output Generation
- **Time Format Handling**
  - Convert raw calculation results to appropriate time format
  - Generate human-readable time values (e.g., "4 hours 30 minutes")
  
- **Fermentation Stage Mapping**
  - Determine key points in fermentation timeline
  - Calculate early, optimal, and late-stage markers

## Technical Implementation

### Algorithm Design
- **Primary Algorithm**
  - Potentially exponential decay function for temperature effects
  - Linear or power function for starter percentage effects
  - Combined model with weighted coefficients

- **Interpolation Methods**
  - Linear interpolation between known data points
  - Curve fitting for smoother transitions
  
- **Edge Case Handling**
  - Guards against extreme input values
  - Reasonable limits and warnings

### Performance Considerations
- **Calculation Efficiency**
  - Optimization for real-time updates
  - Caching of intermediate calculation results
  
- **Memory Usage**
  - Efficient data structures for lookup tables
  - Minimizing redundant calculations

### Testing Framework
- **Unit Tests**
  - Validation against known data points
  - Edge case testing
  
- **Real-World Validation**
  - Comparison with empirical fermentation data
  - Feedback loop for model refinement

## Integration Points

### Input Integration
- **Data Validation**
  - Sanitizing and validating user inputs
  - Providing sensible defaults for missing values
  
- **Event Handling**
  - Responding to input changes
  - Debouncing rapid input adjustments

### Output Integration
- **Result Formatting**
  - Preparing calculation results for display
  - Generating supplementary information
  
- **State Updates**
  - Updating application state with calculation results
  - Triggering UI updates

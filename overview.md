# Sourdough Bulk Fermentation Calculator

## Project Overview
The Sourdough Bulk Fermentation Calculator is a web application designed to help bakers determine optimal bulk fermentation times based on dough temperature and starter percentage. This tool helps achieve consistent results by accounting for the key variables that affect fermentation rates.

## Purpose
- Provide accurate bulk fermentation time estimates based on scientific data
- Accommodate various baking environments and recipe compositions
- Help bakers achieve more consistent results in their sourdough baking

## Core Features
- Temperature input (ambient or dough temperature)
- Starter percentage input (as percentage of total flour weight)
- Calculation of estimated bulk fermentation time
- Visual representation of fermentation progress
- Reference information on fermentation science and best practices

## Technical Architecture
The application will consist of the following components:
1. **User Interface** - Responsive web interface with intuitive controls
2. **Data Model** - Structure for storing fermentation data/formulas
3. **Calculation Engine** - Core algorithms for determining fermentation times
4. **Educational Content** - Contextual information to help users understand results

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)
- Data Storage: JSON or integrated directly in the application code
- Deployment: Static web hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, or similar)

## Development Roadmap
1. Initial data collection and model development
2. Core calculation engine implementation
3. Basic user interface development
4. Educational content creation
5. Testing and refinement
6. Release and user feedback collection

## Success Criteria
- Accurate predictions across various temperature ranges (50째F-85째F/10째C-30째C)
- Support for starter percentages ranging from 5% to 30%
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop devices
- Clear, actionable information that improves baking outcomes
